1. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST || Easy
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/description/

2. Minimum Obstacle Removal to Reach Corner || Medium || ***
//Check BFS Solution
// Used Dijstra
// Grid question
// Allow movement in 4 direction -> don't rely on grid dp traversal, think of graph
// since obstable as 1 think of 0-1 BFS, or Dijstra would work eventually 

3. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I || EASY || *
//When edge weight is 1, BFS 0-1 could be Used

4. Minimum Time to Visit a Cell In a Grid || Medium || ***
//Dijstra Code, Nice implementation
