4004. Kth Smallest Element in a BST || Medium || ***
//Use Iterative, use iterative preorder without DS
//Use Morris traversal for reducing space complexity
//With Morris, return the ans before moving ahead

4005. Validate Binary Search Tree || Easy || ***
//Iterative traversal
//Use Morris traversal for reducing space complexity
//With Morris, return the ans before moving ahead
//Also there is a bound method too, check that out too, PENDING ********
