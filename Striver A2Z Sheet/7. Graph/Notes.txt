$$ Cycle Detection $$

>Undirected Graph
BFS or DFS both could be used, using parent to check if neigh
is Parent or neighbour has formed a cycle.

>Directed Graph
For Directed Graph, Cycle detection code changes as the edges are directed
And possible is there that the node is visited through other route, hence manage 2 ArrayList
visited and path array


$$ Topology Sort $$

Not Possible Under below conditions:
1. Graph is Undirected
2. If Directed graph contains a cycle
If Edge u -> v is present, i.e vertex u comes before v

>DFS
Require Stack and addition in stack placement

>Kahn's Algorithm
