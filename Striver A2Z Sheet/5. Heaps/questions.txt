Min Heap: The minimum key element is present at the root.
Max Heap: The maximum key element is present at the root.

Heap is used to reduce the logN operation to logK.
eg NlogN sorting to NlogK, based on question

5001. Kth Largest Element in an Array || Easy || *
//Learn quickSort approach with the fact that average TC is N^2 resulting TLE

5002. Kth Smallest Element in an Array || Easy 
//Learn quickSort approach with the fact that average TC is N^2 resulting TLE

5003. Sort K sorted array || Easy || *
//Heap reduces the logN to logK

5004. Merge M sorted Lists || Easy 
//Could use inplace, but time complexity could be as n^2, hence use heap
