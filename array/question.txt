6.Longest Consecutive Sequence in an Array *** | Medium
//Consider the case when number can be equal
//If checking condition between loop(ex. comparision with previous index) don't forget to check after loop too

        for(int t : nums){
            if( t == 0){
                mx = Math.max(mx,sum);
                sum = 0;
            }else{
                sum++;
            }
        }
